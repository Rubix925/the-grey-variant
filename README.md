# ollama-ui

Simple HTML UI for Ollama, with added functionality by Grey!

## Current changes
* Removes annoying checksum verification, unnessassary chrome extension and extra files.
* Heavily changes theming.
* Header and page title now say the name of the model instead of just "chat with ollama".

## Planned features:
* Image processing for multimodal models.
* Image generation (Possibly using InvokeAI?)
* Fix Bootstrap UI engine by switching to React
* Real Sex
* Gigahort

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/ollama-ui/ollama-ui
cd ollama-ui
./start.sh
```
